1️⃣ Microservices — What & Why

What they are

An architectural style where an application is split into independently deployable services

Each service owns:

Its business capability

Its data

Its deployment lifecycle

Why microservices

Independent scaling (scale only what’s hot 🔥)

Faster deployments & reduced blast radius

Team autonomy (Conway’s Law in action)

Key principles

Single responsibility per service

Database-per-service (no shared DB)

Communicate via APIs/events, not method calls

Failures are expected → design for resilience

2️⃣ API Gateway — The Front Door

Role of the Gateway

Single entry point for all clients (web, mobile, external)

Sits outside microservices, never contains business logic

Responsibilities

Routing requests to correct service

Authentication & Authorization

Rate limiting & throttling

Request/response transformation

Aggregation (optional, careful usage)

What NOT to put in gateway
❌ Business rules
❌ DB access
❌ Stateful logic

Gateway = traffic cop 🚦, not decision maker

3️⃣ Bounded Contexts (DDD Core Idea)

Problem DDD solves

Same word ≠ same meaning everywhere
Example:

User in Auth ≠ User in Billing ≠ User in Analytics

Bounded Context

A clear boundary within which:

Terms have one meaning

Models are consistent

Teams can move independently

Golden rule

If language or rules change → it’s a different bounded context

4️⃣ DDD Architecture — How to Structure Inside a Service
Layers (inside ONE microservice)

1. Domain Layer (Core)

Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services

Pure business rules

No frameworks, no DB, no HTTP

2. Application Layer

Use cases (orchestrates domain logic)

Transactions

Calls repositories

No business rules, just flow

3. Infrastructure Layer

DB, messaging, external APIs

Framework-specific code

Implements interfaces defined in domain

4. Interface / API Layer

Controllers, REST endpoints

DTOs

Validation

Mapping

5️⃣ Boundaries — The Most Important Concept Today
Types of boundaries you learned

1. Service Boundary

Microservice = deployment + data + ownership boundary

2. Context Boundary

Language & model boundary (DDD)

3. Technical Boundary

API vs Domain vs Infrastructure

4. Transaction Boundary

No distributed transactions

Use eventual consistency

Rule of thumb

Crossing a boundary should feel “expensive”
(API call, event, async message)

6️⃣ Big Picture Mental Model

Each box:

Owns its data

Owns its rules

Owns its failures
